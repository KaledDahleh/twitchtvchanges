This project automatically notifies a Discord channel when a specified Twitch streamer goes live. 
It uses the Twitch Helix API to poll stream status and sends instant alerts through a Discord webhook.
Designed for reliability and low-latency checks, itâ€™s ideal for community servers or stream bots that
need real-time live notifications.
